Randomly-Generated-Bookmarks
============================

This is a simple program designed to be bookmarked and then upon clicking automatically send the user to a random website from their predefined list of websites. I made this for myself one day when I wanted to be productive on the internet but couldn't decide on what website to go to; For best results it's HIGHLY recommened that you change the bookmarks to your personal preferences(The readme will tell you how) and it's also recommended to place the program in your bookmarks toolbar for ease of access and to switch from websites quickly.
